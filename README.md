# UFO Databse Webpage

## Overview of Project
  
Project builds a website which presents and allows users to filter mock[?] UFO sightings data.

## Results
Using the website is as simple as finding the text fields to filter by, typing in the filter one wishes to apply, and pressing enter. The data displayed to the right will then automatically update. Afterward, more filters can be added, subtracted, or modified as the user wishes.

## Summary
The major drawback as far as I can see is the lack of data visualization. This is especially important for public-facing builds, as people tend to be less able to interpret and extrapolate from data than professionals. In addition to recommending a graphing feature for the website, I would also recommend data cleaning. Should that be too simple, I also would recommend a method to acquire more data, such as web scraping an official webpage.
